                Hello! I'm <strong>Marta Teva</strong>, a telecommunications engineer and 
                passionate about the world of <strong>timing and synchronisation.</strong> <br> <br> 
                Right now, I work at a company where I do just that: make 
                things happen at the <strong>exact moment</strong> they need to happen 
                (and believe me, it's more complicated than it sounds).
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                Although I love my job, I also have my own <strong>personal projects </strong>
                that allow me to experiment, learn <strong>new technologies</strong>, and keep 
                alive the curiosity that brought me to engineering in the first 
                place.<br><br>I like to mix the technical with the <strong>creative</strong>, and I'm 
                always looking for new challenges that take me out of my <strong>comfort 
                zone.</strong>

        <div class="about_journey">
            <h1>about<span>my journey</span></h1>
            <p class="p1">
                My journey in telecommunications has been long, intense
                and very enriching. <br> <br> 
                I first studied <strong>Telecommunications Engineering</strong>, 
                where I discovered my fascination with how systems communicate and 
                how technology can <strong>coordinate processes</strong> in ways that previously 
                seemed impossible.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                I then went on to do a related master's degree, delving even deeper 
                into <strong>complex systems</strong>, critical infrastructures and, of course, 
                <strong>synchronisation and timing</strong>. <br> <br> 
                Each year was a mixture of theory, 
                practice and countless hours in the laboratory, working on projects 
                and drinking coffee, but all of that helped me become the <strong>professional</strong>
                I am today.
            </p>

        <div class="about_vision">
            <h1>about <span>vision</span></h1>
            <p class="p1">
                Looking ahead, I have a very clear goal: to <strong>start my own 
                business</strong> in the telecommunications sector.<br> <br> 
                I want to build 
                something of my own, a project where I can apply everything 
                I have learned and bring <strong>my most personal ideas</strong> to life in a 
                real-world setting.<br> <br> 
                I am excited by the idea of contributing 
                something new, <strong>innovative and useful</strong> to the sector, and I know
                that this career path is taking me step by step towards that goal.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                I am convinced that with <strong>effort, perseverance</strong> and a lot of 
                technological <strong>curiosity</strong>, I will achieve it.
